## Data Description - Nic

This data set is a collection of data from 190 countries for COVID19 data. There are 22 variables in the main data set that we will be using for our regression.

### Variables in the main data set

* **date** -	Observation date

* **confirmed** - Cumulative number of confirmed cases

* **tests** - Cumulative number of tests

* **population** - Total population

* **latitude** - Latitude (Check to see if more than 1 since we are only using CA)

* **longitude** - Longitude (Check to see if more than 1 since we are only using CA)

* **school_closing** -	0: No measures - 1: Recommend closing - 2: Require closing (only some levels or categories, eg just high school, or just public schools - 3: Require closing all levels

* **workplace_closing** -	0: No measures - 1: Recommend closing (or work from home) - 2: require closing for some sectors or categories of workers - 3: require closing (or work from home) all-but-essential workplaces (eg grocery stores, doctors). 

* **cancel_events** -	0: No measures - 1: Recommend canceling - 2: Require canceling gatherings_restrictions	0: No restrictions - 1: Restrictions on very large gatherings (the limit is above 1000 people) - 2: Restrictions on gatherings between 100-1000 people - 3: Restrictions on gatherings between 10-100 people - 4: Restrictions on gatherings of less than 10 people.  

* **transport_closing** -	0: No measures - 1: Recommend closing (or significantly reduce volume/route/means of transport available) - 2: Require closing (or prohibit most citizens from using it). 

* **stay_home_restrictions** -	0: No measures - 1: recommend not leaving house - 2: require not leaving house with exceptions for daily exercise, grocery shopping, and “essential” trips - 3: Require not leaving house with minimal exceptions (e.g. allowed to leave only once every few days, or only one person can leave at a time, etc.).  

* **internal_movement_restrictions** -	0: No measures - 1: Recommend closing (or significantly reduce volume/route/means of transport) - 2: Require closing (or prohibit most people from using it).  

* **international_movement_restrictions** -	0: No measures - 1: Screening - 2: Quarantine arrivals from high-risk regions - 3: Ban on high-risk regions - 4: Total border closure.  

* **information_campaigns**	- 0: No COVID-19 public information campaign - 1: public officials urging caution about COVID-19 - 2: coordinated public information campaign (e.g. across traditional and social media).  

* **testing_policy** -	0: No testing policy - 1: Only those who both (a) have symptoms AND (b) meet specific criteria (eg key workers, admitted to hospital, came into contact with a known case, returned from overseas) - 2: testing of anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms - 3: open public testing (eg “drive through” testing available to asymptomatic people).  

* **contact_tracing** -	0: No contact tracing - 1: Limited contact tracing, not done for all cases - 2: Comprehensive contact tracing, done for all cases.

* **key_apple_mobility** -	Identifier used in Apple Mobility Reports.

* **wb** - World Bank Data
